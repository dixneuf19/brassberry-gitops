#cloud-config

# This is the user-data configuration file for cloud-init. By default this sets
# up an initial user called "ubuntu" with password "ubuntu", which must be
# changed at first login. However, many additional actions can be initiated on
# first boot from this file. The cloud-init documentation has more details:
#
# https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/
#
# Some additional examples are provided in comments below the default
# configuration.
